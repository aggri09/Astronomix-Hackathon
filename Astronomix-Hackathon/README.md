## Problem Statement:

Detect exoplanets in stellar light flux data using machine learning models.

**Background:**

Astronomers collect data on stars' light intensity changes to identify exoplanets
orbiting stars beyond our solar system.


**Key Tasks:**

● Data Exploration: Analyzed the data set's structure,and identified relevant attributes for prediction.

● Data Preprocessing:Preprocessed the data, handled missing values and outliers.

● Model Building: Developed predictive models (e.g., machine learning, statistical) for estimating impact likelihood.

● Model Optimization: Fine-tuned hyperparameters, preventing overfitting or underfitting.

● Validation and Testing: Validate model performance using appropriate techniques, tested on unseen data.

● Presentation: Prepared a compelling presentation summarizing the problem, data,approach, and results.
